# Warehouse-App

**Backend**

(Maybe write a shell script to automate this?)
How to set up:

```git clone -b Backend https://github.com/Nakov-School/Warehouse-App.git```

```cd Warehouse-App && gradle build```

```docker build -t warehouse .```

```docker run -p 8080:8080 warehouse```

Now, you should see `Hello World` at http://localhost:8080/
